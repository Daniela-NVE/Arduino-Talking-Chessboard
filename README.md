# Arduino-Talking-Chessboard
GMR Switch Smart Chess Board

Reads an 8 x 8 array of AD024 GMR magnetic switches and displays the time of moves and moves in algebraic notation.


A0-A3, P9-P10, and P12-P13 are sensor selects (ranks/rows) connected to sensor VDDs; P0-P2/P4-P8 read the sensor outputs (files/columns). 


SDA and SCL connect to a 20 x 4 LCD Module. P3 is audio; P11 is mute. 


Disconnect P0-P1 to allow USB programming.
